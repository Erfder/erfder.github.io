        <h3 id="sausage">Chinese Sausage</h3>
        <p>Our sausage utilizes fatty pork to deliver your taste buds a very traditional meal. <q>There is a choice of fatty or skimmed sausages. There are different kinds ranging from those made using fresh pork to those made using pig livers, duck livers and even turkey livers. Usually a livery sausage will be darker in color than one made without liver. Recently, there have even been countries producing chicken Chinese sausages. Traditionally they are classified into two main types.Chinese sausage is used as an ingredient in quite a number of dishes in southern Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Sichuan and Hunan, and also Hong Kong. Sichuan sausage also contains red chili powder and Sichuan pepper powder, which gives the sausage a special flavor. Two common examples of such dishes include fried rice and lo mai gai. The traditional unpackaged forms are usually found in street market or wet markets.</q> <em>See link 1.</em></p>
        <h3 id="prawn">Chinese King Prawn</h3>
        <p>Our prawn is no longer fried to preserve a fresh, "out of the Pacific" taste. <q>Prawn is a common name, used particularly in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Commonwealth nations, for large swimming crustaceans or shrimp, especially those with commercial significance in the seafood industry. Shrimp that fall in this category often belong to the suborder Dendrobranchiata. In North America, the term is used less frequently, typically for freshwater shrimp.</q><em> See link 2</em> <br> <br><strong>A Nice Recipe We Used to Use:</strong><em> See link 3.</em>

        <h3 id="dim">Dim Sum</h3>
        <p><q>A traditional dim sum brunch includes various types of steamed buns such as cha siu baau, dumplings and rice noodle rolls (cheong fun), which contain a range of ingredients, including beef, chicken, pork, prawns and vegetarian options. Many dim sum restaurants also offer plates of steamed green vegetables, roasted meats, congee porridge and other soups. Dessert dim sum is also available and many places offer the customary egg tart. Dim sum can be cooked by steaming and frying, among other methods. The serving sizes are usually small and normally served as three or four pieces in one dish. It is customary to order family style, sharing dishes among all members of the dining party. Because of the small portions, people can try a wide variety of food.</q> <em>See link 4.</em></p>
        <h3 id="rice">Bastrami Rice</h3>
        <p><q>Rice is the staple food of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific. A detailed analysis of nutrient content of rice suggests that the nutrition value of rice varies based on a number of factors. It depends on the strain of rice, that is between white, brown, black, red and purple varieties of rice – each prevalent in different parts of the world. It also depends on nutrient quality of the soil rice is grown in, whether and how the rice is polished or processed, the manner it is enriched, and how it is prepared before consumption.</q> <em>See link 5.</em></p>
